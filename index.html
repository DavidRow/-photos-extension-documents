            <h1>What is the "Google Photos Extension"? </h1>
                <p> It is an extension for google chrome that adds a button with the words "Save to Google Photos" on the context menu when clicking on an image.<br> 
                    When this button is clicked it uploads that image to the currently signed in google account.<br> 
                    If no one is signed in or you are offline then it will not upload an image.</p>

            <h1>What will this app do with user data?</h1>
                
                <p> The google photos extension uses the scope: “photoslibrary.appendonly” <br> 
                    This means that this app has the ability to upload data to the user's google photo storage.<br> 
                    It will only upload the images where the user selected the "Save to Google Photos" option on the context menu. 
                </p>
                <hr>
            <h1>How does this app enhance user functionality?</h1>
            It does this by making it easier to upload images to Google Photos.<br> 
            Without this app, if you wanted to save an image from chrome and upload it into google photos you would need to download it and then manually upload it.<br> 
            using this app it takes a single click to do that whole process.
